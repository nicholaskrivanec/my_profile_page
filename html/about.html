	    <p>
	      I was born in Bountiful Utah on November 21st, 1988. I've lived in Utah for my entire life. 
	      I am the youngest child of 4; I have one older sister and two older brothers.

	    </ul>
	    
	    
			<h3>Major(s)</h3>
			<p>
	      When I first started at Weber State, I went into cello performance. The cello program is definitely one of my favorite parts about Weber State. 
	      During my first couple semesters at Weber, I met my wife. She was part of the piano department, so I saw quite a bit of her around the Browning Center.
	      After we got married, I was young and dumb, and postponed the rest of my education.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      After about 5 years, I returned back to Ogden, and now I'm still at Weber working on a degree in Computer Science. 
	      The reason I switched my major was because Computers are the second passion of mine,
	      and let's be honest, it will most likely pay a little more than a degree in Cello Performance.

	    <h2>Work:</h2>
	    
	    <h3>Landscaping</h3>
	    <p>
	      Mostly, during my life, I've been self-employed or have worked with my family. My father is an entrepeneur/business owner;
	  	  Ever since I can remember, My dad has owned a landscaping business.
	  	  When I was still in elementary school, I was paid to help out in whatever way I could around his job-sites.
	  	  Basically, I have worked as a landscaper for over 15 years. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>Cello:</h3>
	    <p>
	      When I was about 8 years old, my mother bought me a cello. 
	  	  She's a violinist, and a private teacher, so it was just natural for me to pick the cello up. 
	      I fell in love with it in middle school, and devoted the majority of my days to practicing. 
	  	  While my friends were listening to Green Day and Nirvana, I was listening to Bach and Dvorak.
	      Anyway, what came of that was me becoming a private instructor. I have taught cellists off and on for 8 or so years. 
	  	  Right now, I am not teaching because I am trying to graduate, but I hope to continue after I finish my education.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>UPS</h3> 
	    <p>
	  	  Currently, I am working for UPS as a Package-Handler, and I also drive on Saturdays delivering air parcels. 
	  	  I've been working for UPS for a little over 2 years. Everyday, I wake up around 2:30am, and I go to work.
	      I like my job, because it forces me to get exercise.

	    <h3>My Marriage</h3>
	    <p>
	      As mentioned before, I met my wife, Angie, at Weber. She is the perfect compliment to everything in my life. 
	  	  We have been married for 5 years. A lot of people have told me that the first year of marriage is the hardest;
	  	  however, for me, the first year of my marriage was better than anything. It was me living with my best friend.
	  	  Every year I've spent with my wife since has been better than the year before.

	    <h3>My Daughter</h3>
	    <p>
	      After being married for a couple of years, we decided to have a child. We were lucky enough to have a daughter.
	  	  Her name is Gracie Isabelle, and she is the best 3 year old in the world...most of the time.
	  	  She was born on Christmas-Eve a few years ago, which made her the best Christmas present ever.
